# Language-and-AI

## Setup of the Environment
We used Python 3.12 with the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Use the following commands in your terminal to install the right packages in Python 3.12:

1. `python -m venv venv`
2. win: `.\venv\Scripts\activate` / macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Organization
### Model selection
In the folder model selection you can find the notebook with the different models we tried (ridge regression, Random Forest and BERT). The accompanying results from the runs can be found in the excel file.
